The Eisenhower Matrix, which is a great tool for prioritizing tasks, built using Gemini. It's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. You'll be able to create tasks and assign them to one of the four quadrants: Urgent &amp; Important, Important &amp; Not Urgent, Urgent &amp; Not Important, and Not Urgent &amp; Not Important.
